# Scientific Calculator

This is a Python-based scientific calculator that provides basic arithmetic functions as well as trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions. Constants like pi and e are also available.

## Getting Started

To use this calculator, simply run the `calculator.py` file in your preferred Python environment.

## Usage

The calculator displays a graphical user interface (GUI) with a text entry field for input and buttons for various operations. Basic arithmetic functions are available via the following buttons:

- `+` for addition
- `-` for subtraction
- `*` for multiplication
- `/` for division

The following buttons provide additional functionality:

- `sin`, `cos`, `tan` for trigonometric functions
- `log` for logarithmic functions
- `exp` for exponential functions
- `pi` for the mathematical constant pi
- `e` for the mathematical constant e

To perform a calculation, simply enter the desired expression in the text entry field and press the `=` button. The calculator will evaluate the expression and display the result.

## Examples

Here are some examples of expressions that can be evaluated by the calculator:

- `2 + 3 * 4`: evaluates to 14
- `sin(pi/4)`: evaluates to 0.7071067811865475
- `log(e^3)`: evaluates to 3.0
