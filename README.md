# Python Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini projects written in Python. 
Each project is designed to demonstrate a particular concept or feature of the language. 

The projects are organized into folders, each containing the source code and any necessary data files. 
The README file in each folder provides an overview of the project and instructions for running it. 

If you have any questions or comments about these projects, please feel free to contact me.

This my mini-projects that you may be interested in doing too... Enjoy!!
